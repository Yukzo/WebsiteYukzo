<div class="textlog"><br><br><h1>Log-4 12/07/24</h1><br> <b>Good Afternoon</b> <br> I'm officially an International Baccalaureate Graduate!  <br> Being done with High School is a weird feeling. You will never have that annoying feeling of being in a boring class and having no one to talk to. But hey I'm glad that I'm gone. <br> I will miss the good moments I had with my friends in Computer Science class and in French (no homo Marcus). But now I'm going to go to Uni with my best friend Better Call Al! Which is exciting!<br> I hope you have a great day. <br> Kind Regards, <br>Yukzo</div>

<div class="textlog"><br><br><h1>Log-3 11/04/24</h1><br> <b>Good Afternoon</b> <br> Currently in english class, kinda bored so I decided to do some changes on the website.  <br> Kind happy that I made that site! It is terrible since I am using jquery but at the end of the day, I don't really care. It's just a stupid website <br> that I've made because I wanted a treelink type of site. Anyways, I hope that<br> you have a great day. <br> Kind Regards, <br>Yukzo</div>

<div class="textlog"><br><br><h1>Log-2 09/04/24</h1><br> <b>Good morning!</b> <br> Currently edging myself as we speak. I mean OVH is edging me, by taking a gazilion years to update their DNS settings.<br>Anyways. I'm kinda happy about this site, there are a few things I should fix such as the text in the links tab. <br>Anyways, I hope that you have an amazing day whoever you are. <br> Kind Regards, <br>Yukzo</div>

<div class="textlog"><br><br><h1>Log-1 08/04/24</h1><br> <b>Hey, how is it going?</b> <br> I made this website because I realized that I owned the yukzo.xyz domain name. So I decided to do some sort of custom linktree type of website. Looks alright for someone with barely any HTML and CSS experience.<br>I mean it feels like basically writing instructions to ChatGPT, like <u>border-color: red;</u> and it actually does it like that without a gazilion shenanigans.<br>Anyways, I hope that you have an amazing day whoever you are.</div>
